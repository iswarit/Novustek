pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

2] Now, we'll create a virtual environment for a project

mkvirtualenv mywebsite
3] To activate the environment mywebsite we have to run the following command.

workon mywebsite
4] Next, we are going to install Django with the pip command

pip install django
5] You can check the django version by executing the following command.

python -m django --version
6] We'll set the current directory to C drive.

cd \
7] The next step is to create a new directory to store the new project that we are going to work on. In this case it will be webdesign.

mkdir newdir
Once you create the directory, set it as the current directory.

cd newdir
8] Now, we need to startproject with the django-admin startproject projectname where we will replace the projectname with a name of the project.

As I have mentioned already it this case it will be webdesign.

django-admin startproject webdesign
9] Set the current directory to the project directory i.e webdesign.

cd webdesign
10] After that is done simply run the

python manage.py runserver
Now that we have completed the installation you might have this question,
how to check if django is installed on windows?

Execute the following command and it will return the version of your django install.

django-admin --version
You can uninstall django with a simple command. To uninstall django windows 10 just execute the following command.

pip uninstall django
